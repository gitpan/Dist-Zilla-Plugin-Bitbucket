NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bitbucket - Plugins to integrate Dist::Zilla with
    Bitbucket

VERSION

      This document describes v0.001 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bitbucket - released November 03, 2014 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Bitbucket.

DESCRIPTION

    This is a set of plugins for Dist::Zilla intended to more easily
    integrate Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org> in the dzil workflow.

    The following is the list of the plugins shipped in this distribution:

      * Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bitbucket::Create

      Create Bitbucket repo on dzil new

      * Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bitbucket::Update

      Update Bitbucket repo info on release

      * Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bitbucket::Meta

      Add Bitbucket repo info to META.{yml,json}

 Configuration

    Configure git with your Bitbucket credentials:

            $ git config --global bitbucket.user LoginName
            $ git config --global bitbucket.password MySecretPassword

    Alternatively you can install Config::Identity and write your
    credentials in the (optionally GPG-encrypted) ~/.bitbucket file as
    follows:

            login LoginName
            password MySecretPassword

    (if only the login name is set, the password will be asked
    interactively)

ATTRIBUTES

 remote

    Specifies the git/hg remote name to use (default 'origin').

 repo

    Specifies the name of the Bitbucket repository to be created (by
    default the name of the dist is used). This can be a template, so
    something like the following will work:

            repo = {{ lc $dist -> name }}

 scm

    Specifies the source code management system to use.

    The possible choices are hg and git. It will be autodetected from the
    distribution root directory if not provided.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    This dist was shamelessly copied from ALEXBIO's excellent

    I didn't implement the PluginBundle nor the Command::gh modules as I
    didn't have a need for them. Please let me know if you want them!
